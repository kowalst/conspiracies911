							<li>CAROL MORELLO Washington Post Staff Writer. (2004). One Man's Unorthodox Ideas About the 9/11 Attack on the Pentagon Go Global in a Flash. Welcome to the Internet, Where Conspiracy Theories Flourish. The Washington Post, B1B.</li>
							<p> 
								<br>
								This 2004 The Washington Post article is one of the earlier written pieces on 9/11 conspiracy theories on the internet. The article details an English man named Darren Warren who claims that a missile or small plane flew into the Pentagon on 9/11 rather than the airliner. It is interesting to see that even in 2004, Warren claims that there ate "10,000 people" communicating with him about 9/11 conspiracy theories such as his own.
								<br><br>
								Warren is also the creator of the website www.pentagonstrike.co.uk which may be an interesting resource to analyze further. On another website (www.cassiopaea.org), the owner claims that his site would crash because there were so many interested persons visiting after the upload of a video supporting his conspiracy theory.
								<br><br>
								On another note, the article names a few scholars who make various claims about the nature of conspiracy theories. One claim is that it is natural for conspiracies to grow after a traumatic event. Another insight is that in 2004, conspiracy theories seemed to not have any partisan bias in the number of supporters which I find fascinating since many of the claims blame the Bush administration. One of the final claims is that supporters of these conspiracy theories become radical, make it part of their identity, and are very unlikely to ever renounce their beliefs.

							<p>
								<br>
								In this article, Berman dives into the relationship between conspiracy theories, misinformation, the internet, and how 9/11 conspiracy theories enter the classroom of people who may not even remember the event. Berman states that 9/11 is essentially the root of many conspiracy theories in the 21st century. He compares the 9/11 conspiracy theories to more modern ones such as QAnon, Plandemic, and Pizzagate.
								<br><br>
								He compares these three conspiracies as that they are all based on manipulated informational sources that distort reality. Another similarity he assigns is that the ability to view and provide information instantly over the internet has caused conspiracy theory communities to evolve faster and grow larger. Finally, the last similarity is that conspiracy theories ultimately grow large because of human interaction and experiencing positive feedback from one another.
								<br><br>
								Currently, many teachers are noticing conspiracy theories being spread in school, and Berman provides a few approaches teachers can use to combat this. First is to ask the students for evidence to support their theory. Second is to teach about 9/11 conspiracy theories explicitly. Third is to use documentary film to combat conspiracies.

							<p>
								<br>
								Jones notes how conspiracy can be viewed as “knowledge-producing discourse”. The growth of conspiracy theories is easily visible through the inflation of such organizations such as '9/11 Truth Movement' as well as through our government such as the Bush administration's rhetoric surrounding terrorist intention on infiltrating our land. Jones demonstrates the process in which conspiracy theories are formed through constructing her argument, countering her own argument, and deconstructing said counter. Jones grounds her analysis by criticizing members of the 9/11 Truth Movement which makes for an entertaining read.

								Dr. Charles Soukip got his Ph.D. in Communication Studies from the University of Nebraska. His research includes examining communities on the internet, the discourse of film and tv, and digital pop culture text. He has published in multiple journals including The Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication and New Media and Society. This journal article goes over conspiracy theories around 9/11 as well as their influence and misleading legitimacy. Dr. Soukip highlights two sources of the spread of conspiracies being the film Loose Change and the website 911Truth.org. He concludes one of the main reasons people fall into conspiring about major tragedies like 9/11 or the JFK assassination is rooted in egocentrism and a “desire-based reality or hyperreality.”

								Carl Stempel and Guido Stempel were both professors at universities and Thomas Hargrove served in the army but, later went on to become a writer and editor for the International Rice Research Institute. This article survives 1,010 random people and asks them their view of three conspiracy theories regarding the events of 9/11. The writers found evidence that lower social classes and people who consume less legitimate media are more likely to believe at least one of the conspiracies. They found evidence that people who consume legitimate media are less likely to believe any of the conspiracy theories.

								Viren Swami is a Professor of Social Psychology at Anglia Ruskin University in the United Kingdom. Swami introduces the idea that conspiracy theories are built purely off the idea that information is purposely being withheld from the public by multiple actors in order to cover up an event that can be considered a secret, unlawful, or evil plot. Swami highlights the movement behind 9/11 Truth, and how the members frequently met online or through national/international conferences. Swami notes the lack of any empirical research into the construction of conspiracy theories. Swami takes 257 participants in order to study the level of belief in a conspiracy such as the killing of President Kennedy. This lets Swami use a plethora of scales in order to measure the level of belief in a certain conspiracy. This study has begun the examination of the psychological correlations in relation to 9/11 and conspiracy theories themselves.

								This article puts conspiracy theories in the perspectives of the conspiracist and why and how they presented their theories on 9/11. Conspiracistst were largely not willing to apply the “conspiracy” label to their own beliefs and theories and found it objective when others did. Backing up the theory that conspiracy theories carry a social-stigma. Later in the article they conducted a similar research project to our data research project and they took keywords on news websites such as ABC and researched advanced articles on 9/11. Then they extracted all the actually persuasive comments on the articles that related to conspiracies, and posted it onto this article to present what they found. They collected 2174 comments and of them 1459 were coded as conspiracist and 715 as conventionalists. Out of all of the news sites; ABC, CNN, Daily Mail ,and Independent they were all found to have similar amounts of conspiracy theories in the comment sections of the articles. These findings led to the finding that “For many conspiracists, there are two worlds: one real and (mostly) unseen, the other a sinister illusion meant to cover up the truth; and evidence against the latter is evidence for the former.” (Michael J. Wood 2013).

								<br>
								This is an article written by J McGee in 2011 following the ideas of Richard Hofstadter's essay “the Paranoid Style in American Politics.” Sense that essay;  9/11 conspiracy theories became very popular and well known. This paper looks at a bunch of conspiracy theories including 9/11 and Barack Obama, and how he was not born in the United States. Relating to Richard Hofstadter's  and his early essay on conspiracy theories, we now can understand how that essay foresaw and summarized problems in 1964 with the political system and the conspiracies about it, similarly to now with 9/11. McGee ends the article by stating; “We cannot afford to dismiss such thinking as”crazy” and resist enlightenment ourselves”. He finally puts his full argument at the end and states how he thinks the conspiracies are a good thing and that they make the truth heard even if some of them seem “crazy”.

							</li>
							<p>
								<br>
								Oliver discusses how Americans seem to have a proclivity towards conspiracy theories, and that there has been a surprising dearth of information on how they gain support within the populace. Though there seems to be a relationship with how widespread a theory is with the amount of people believing it, as discussed in the interviews that they staged, asking people about conspiracy theories ranging from Truthers to 9/11. Overall an interesting paper with a few fun charts to peruse over.

							</li>
							<p>
								<br>
								Prooijen, Willem, and Vugt's paper talks about conspiracy theories, like 9/11 being an inside job, and puts out two theories and how/why humans are drawn to them. The first one being that it's essentially our ability to recognize patterns working in overdrive. Essentially seeing connections that aren't actually there. The second possible reason is that if a dangerous event happens, our survival instincts want to name a source, so we know to avoid it to, well, live. There even is a tangent on how it may be a function of both, just our brains trying to find out where the dangers in the world are, and seeing connections that aren't there. Overall a fun thinkpiece.
