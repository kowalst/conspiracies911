						<h2>Introduction</h2>
						<p>The internet is a paradox unto itself. Despite being set up by lines of code and strict rules, it is fluid on how it works, changing as the ideas of the world at large shift in real time. If you could put the internet on a physical timeline, you would be able to see how public perceptions of an event or incident can change over time within a demographic. No case is more prevalent than looking at the conception and formations of conspiracy theories regarding the attacks during 9/11.</p>
						<p>The founder of the Internet Archive is Brewster Kahle. His focus was to provide “universal access to all knowledge”. This led to the creation of his first website, the “Thinking Machines”, then, the “Wide Area Information” and later “Alexa Internet” which finally led to the formation of the “Internet Archive” in 1996. The tool we used is the Wayback Machine, which is an extension of the “Internet Archive”.</p>
						<p>The Wayback Machine hosts a large majority of the data stored on the internet and has saved over 652 billion web pages from 1996 to now. A large hot spot of activity, that can be noticed on the internet, were the terrorist attacks that happened on September 11th, 2001. Our project utilizes the Wayback Machine in order to track data from the 9/11 terrorist attacks. We analyzed the networks in which this data comes from and where it ended up spreading. 9/11 conspiracies became popular with films like Loose Change and websites like 911truth.org, which aim to create a false narrative in the audience's head. Theorists have claimed many things, for example; the deep state staged attacks or the U.S. government knew about the attacks ahead of time, and, of course, the alleged fact that jet fuel could not melt steel beams so, the towers could not have possibly fallen. These theories spread on the internet and mainly through social media, conspiracy websites, and political movements with the goal to expose the deep state and create a sense of distrust between the people and the government. We started by collecting websites for our project and analyzed early articles on conspiracy theories after the initial attack. Our primary method of doing so was by following hyperlinks that have been collected into more of a singular category of theories. Our guidelines for the websites are that they have to focus on the media structure, social structure, and the spread of belief in 9/11 conspiracy theories.</p>
					

					<div id="section-2"></div>

						<h2>Findings</h2>
						<p>One website that we heavily focused on was 911truth.org. This website's primary purpose is to push false narratives/information to its readers. We've collected snapshots of the articles they have published, dating as early as 2002. The first, and arguably the most infamous conspiracy theory that we looked at, was the idea that jet fuel can't melt steel beams when superheated. This theory rose to relevance after FEMA released its report stating that the inspection of the World Trade Center was insufficient which, in itself, led to a full-scale investigation of the National Institute of Standards and Technology or NIST for short. This was just the beginning of what we could find when diving into the Wayback Machine.</p>
						<p>Another major conspiracy theory that we analyzed was the hearing for the lack of response from the North American Air Defense command (NORAD). This article aims to set a false narative against NORAD, blaming the lack of fighter jets and general response to the 9/11 attacks on the incompetence of the government. This article uses the window of time that the first 9/11 flight veered off its course, to the flight that hit the Pentagon as a way to accuse the government of purposefully holding back any response. This blame soon focused on the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), as the minutes continued to pass the response time became slower and slower.</p>
					

					<section id="section-3">
						<h2>Data Visualization</h2>					
						<p>These graphs chart the frequency in which these specific words were used over 19 different articles that we collected from 911 truth.org. This gave us major insight into what this community was focused on during these moments in time. As you can see, there was lots of talk about a possible cover-up and the destruction of the towers, whilst later we observed the frequency in which the word “trade” was used more frequently, possibly hinting towards the rise of theories surrounding the World Trade Center itself. This helped a lot, as the textual analysis tool helped us filter through a lot of click-bait and filler this website had to offer and let us pick out keywords that were relevant to our research.</p>
						<p>Look at Media for example, there was a downward trend in the word usage as the word Media. As the attacks were fresh, discussions of how the media covering the events fueled the theory that the attacks were known about beforehand and that the government let it happen as an excuse to go to war, making sure that the event was covered to make America ready for war. However that changed as the average conversation about 9/11 started dwindling, so did the talk about how the media played into it. However there was a spike in 2015-2016 due to the presidential race, with the oncoming popularity of the “fake news/fake media” conspiracy that former candidate Donald Trump kept proclaiming. That theory was that the Media/Major News organizations fed propaganda to the American public and lied to them. As he kept making those claims, the belief in those theories surged.</p>
						<p>This was important to keep track of as the constantly shifting dynamics of conspiracy theories can, and has led to the complete restructuring of certain ideas and thinking.</p>

						<h2>Place in the Literature</h2>
						<p>One of the better places to look is the website “9/11 Truth” Both at the beginning and further along the timelines. Scholars generally agree that conspiracists show the most activity when an event appears inadequate or when no explanation exists. These conspiracy theories are then endorsed by other members of the public and carried onto later years, possibly adjusting the  original claim and turning it into a totally different idea. 9/11 was no different, the event frightened the United States and created public discomfort between the people and the government, spawning the stream of conspiracies and conspiracists alike. During our interview with Dr. Stempel, he introduced the idea that there is right wing conspiracy thinking and that there is left wing conspiracy thinking. From his perspective “Right wing media gets brought to the mainstream more quickly” than “it does on the left” this is because it is the more dangerous and flashy groupings of conspiracy theories.</p>

						<h2>Significance</h2>
						<p>Conspiracies have begun flooding American culture and society in recent years. These conspiracies create communities of like minded people, with polarized viewpoints on social and political topics. This project tracked one of these conspiracies and the reason a project like this worked is because of our abilities to map shifts in human ideas over time. This can help monitor n help to delegitimize democratic government, demonize innocent groups that have been falsely portrayed as evil, and shift attention away from the real causes/perpetrators.</p>
						<p>There are many questions that our project answered, like the significance of social mediaand analyze psychological patterns within humans. We also have another tool to help monitor sociological phenomena. It is important to know the effects of these conspiracy theories; they ca, how these theories spread online, and the current state of the 9/11 conspiracy community. Scholarly journal articles can give a fair analysis of the sociology behind the ways people of this time period were thinking and how specific events affected political groups. This was significant when doing textual and network analysis for this data set. Our project needed the perspective of sociological theories and patterns to draw conclusions from the data in the Wayback Machine. When taking the ideas from scholarly journal articles, and applying them to the data set and drawing conclusions, our project answered our questions about 9/11 conspiracy theories and could possibly set a framework to look at other conspiracy theories that are worth investigating.</p>

						<h2>Subject Matter Expert Interview</h2>
						<p>Thomas: What? Um, so I know the article was posted in 2001. Was that when the study was conducted?</p>
						<p>Dr. Stempel: No, it was. It was published in 2007.</p>
						<p>Thomas: oh I'm sorry, 2007.</p>
						<p>Dr. Stempel: And, and I'm trying to remember when the survey, it's been a while since I've looked at this stuff. I think the survey was done In 2007. I would have said, I could go back and look, but I thought it was more the survey was done more around 2003. Or a little later, it might have been, you know, what, actually, I think it was actually done in 2006. It was several years after. Yeah, we wanted to capture how much the you know, how much the conspiracy thinking was good was still circulating at that point.</p>
						<p>Thomas: Okay. All right.</p>
						<p>Dr. Stempel: Yeah, I think it was 2006 actually.</p>
						<p>Thomas: Okay. And then, um, so for the the study that you conducted, you were looking at different media sources that the individuals were consuming, including, like the, like tabloids, and then..</p>
						<p>Dr. Stempel: like radio, regular news coverage. Do you think that social media back then didn't have the same? I mean, it existed, you know, Myspace? I don't remember exactly when Facebook started, but it didn't have the same. The same, I don't know, didn't have the same kind of influence. So what it was, you know, it thinks things were were somewhat interactive, but they didn't circulate conspiracies. My sense. And, and I, it's, again, it's been a while is that they didn't circulate as rapidly as they do now. Yeah. Dead as widely as they do, as they do now. Bye. Bye, kind of a long shot quite a bit less. But we are aware that they were and we wanted to see, you know, we wanted to we wanted to establish if this relationship was already emerging.</p>
						<p>Thomas: Yeah. And then I was a little bit younger, back then. But was there like, a similar media bias at that time as there is today? Because like, now we have CNN and Fox News and then..</p>
						<p>Dr. Stempel: MSNBC. Yeah. So I would say that, again, I'm not an expert on this, but thinks it probably gotten more polarized. Certainly, Fox was already to a great extent how they are now. But they did. One of the things I don't know if you noticed this in the article, but one of the things is that Fox News did not trade trading conspiracy as much as they do now. There's a there's, again, I so I kind of have to preface everything I say by saying you know that there are other people who are much more up on this, I've moved on to studying other things. And i, i from i pay attention to some of it. I've developed viewpoints on things. But I don't not all of them. So some of the things I'm going to say are kind of my general sense is that if you look at more closely, you may find out I'm wrong. Right now, I'm just practicing that that way. I would say that things are more polarized now. But sometimes when people say polarized, it just makes it so you know, it's kind of this. There's like it's symmetrical. And there's there's really good studies. If you're if you haven't read them, I can recommend what you can email me and I can recommend a book like set of studies. That just I can't I can't say it right now that They showed pretty convincingly that conspiracy thinking on in the right wing media gets brought to the mainstream more quickly. Yeah. Much more quickly than it does on the on the left. So the basic model would be that, yeah, there's left wing conspiracy thinking, and there's right wing conspiracy thinking, and then there's kind of stuff that's, you know, sort of more generic. But one of the things that I'm sure you since you're focusing on 911 stuff, I'm pretty sure you're aware that when we did our study, if it leans more towards liberals and Democrats..</p>
						<p>Thomas: yeah, I thought that was really interesting, actually.</p>
						<p>Dr. Stempel: Yeah. And it makes sense. If you think about the model we developed with regard to trust, which I think a lot of other people have expanded on. Much better than we did. We were, you know, we were kind of the field didn't have a lot. We didn't have a lot to reference when we did our study. But we we glommed on to the idea of trust being central, pretty early on, and I believe we drew on, work on rumors, to some extent that was, you know, was focusing, you know, focused on trust, as well. But But at any rate, they thinks we're, at the time, you know, the 911 conspiracies, they all kind of made the Bush administration complicit. And there were there were, you know, there were tons of liberals and Democrats who felt that Bush had stolen the 2000 election and had fabricated the excuse to go into Iraq. And so there was, there was a very, right around 2006, there was a very low level of trust in Bush by people on the left. And it's that distrust that opens you to believing conspiracies, to summit that's at least one important model to have in mind. And so and so, as as, you know, as things have gotten, as more distance has come. And in the right, my view of things is that the right has has sort of hit on conspiracy thinking as a way to mobilize people more than the Democrats have certainly in a mainstream way that, that I believe, it's if people go through I'm not sure what all different methods it would take. But I think you'd be able to tease out that that. You know, that was very much related to this shift to where now? It's I don't think it's super strong, but the majority of 911 conspiracy believers are right wingers now. So there's been a transition that way.</p>
						<p>Thomas: Yeah, no, I found that part of the article really interesting. Actually, that was gonna be my next question for you.</p>
						<p>Dr. Stempel: Okay.</p>
						<p>Thomas: So at the start of the article, it was talking about a, like us versus them, like thinking style, and then a paranoid thinking style. There's a another research article that was reading, and they made the assumption that more people who believe in conspiracies, they have like a kind of like egotistical, like viewpoint and thinking that they know more than everyone else, and that kind of thrives, their thinking more interesting.</p>
						<p>Dr. Stempel: Okay. So so you want to know what I think of that, or?</p>
						<p>Thomas: Yeah, just your opinion.</p>
						<p>Dr. Stempel: Okay. Well, I'll try not to be too long winded, but but I do actually. I I would need to look at it more closely. But my initial reaction is that I, I would find that less helpful. Yeah, I get I'm going to give you an example because maybe helps me understand or has a recent study that didn't focus especially on conspiracy thinking. But that help helps. That kind of fits in with my way of thinking about it the way that it's evolved, it's sort of building off I still think that the trust is is central. Another thing that I think you'll see is that it has been we emphasize, you know, kind of a degree There's also an element of kind of social and political alienation. And so there's a there's a study, it's not a it's not certainly study or quantitative study done by a sociologist named Jennifer Silva. And the title of the book is we're still here. And she looks at and she goes into, she does an ethnography of an answer of a dying anthracite coal town in kind of North and a little west of Philadelphia. And, and what she shows is that a lot of the people there whose whose parents or grandparents were coal miners, strong union people, strong Democrats pro, you know, engaged in a number, you know, in a lot of kind of collective solidarity, that, that they that they now don't trust anyone that the younger generation thinks have gone so bad, and so downhill. And there's so few opportunities where they live. And they're, you know, there's, you know, there's a good amount of drug addiction and things like that, that they, that they've come to rely only on themselves. And so if I was to look from the outside, look at that, and say, Oh, they're being egotistical in some in some of the people, and a good number of these people, as they try and make sense of the world, because they have so little trust, there's the theme of trust, again, they have so little trust in government. They have so little trust in, in other institutions. And they in the, you know, they kind of, I mean, everybody's heard the phrase, you know, trust no one they take, they take that as like an ethos. Okay, yeah. And you could see that as being egotistical, but I, as a sociologist would see it more as a, as a somewhat justified I don't agree with them, but a somewhat justified you know, social isolation, you know, alienation, social alienation, or social isolation that they've had, their, their family relationships that they've been let down by their work relationships, they're exploited in through casualized. Labor, it's underpaid, you know, things like that. And so I went in off the bat without knowing anything else. If I if I heard somebody say, yeah, it's either egotistical, I would be, I would be looking at and say, how much of what you're leaving labeling egotistical? And they would sound egotistical they would they, you know, they develop these elaborate conspiracies, that makes them feel like they're in control of things. Right. Yeah, they, they feel like, Oh, I've got a handle. Everybody else is kind of duped, you know, and stuff like that. But that, that I I would be, I would feel that it was a was biased. Call them egotistical now. That you may be there. I can see that as an element as long as you're looking at the broader context.</p>
						<p>And the other thing I would say is that I is that I do believe that there are different types. So I'm not saying, you know, they could be actually referencing a different type. And, you know, that I'm just not familiar with or haven't thought through about. And so that could, that could be what's going on as well. The final thing that I feel compelled to say now, and then I told you, I was going to try not to be too long. The final thing, I'll say now is that I believe that all of us are capable, because I see it as as as as conspiracy thinking, as you know, related to social relations of trust. is very much, you know, or at least the type that I would focus on the that trust and I guess the other thing I would add would be loss, maybe especially status loss. But but that because of that I I think that we're all capable of in situations. You know, where where we've lost trust and leaders or trust in institutions that have grounded us in the past? I know, you know, my dad was a member of union and I no longer trust union, sir. You know, that kind of thing. Yeah. That, that we're, we're all capable of developing conspiracy type thinking. And then we have other forces within us that, you know, the pushback against that. Right. But the, but we, I think those impulses are one of the things we tried to do, it was very hard to do with just survey data, right. But one of the things we tried to do was to avoid, and we and we are quite explicit about how we, we felt that I guess the summarize that I can say that hosters view, even though there's no doubt something to that the paranoid style and American thoughts in the how it comes, especially from the right. The we, we try to, to, we felt that that pathologized it too much, it pathologized it psychologize that too much. And that's why we emphasize those, those other things.</p>

						<h2>Annotated Bibliography</h2>

						<ul>
							<li>CAROL MORELLO Washington Post Staff Writer. (2004). One Man's Unorthodox Ideas About the 9/11 Attack on the Pentagon Go Global in a Flash. Welcome to the Internet, Where Conspiracy Theories Flourish. The Washington Post, B1B.</li>
							<p> 
								<br>
								This 2004 The Washington Post article is one of the earlier written pieces on 9/11 conspiracy theories on the internet. The article details an English man named Darren Warren who claims that a missile or small plane flew into the Pentagon on 9/11 rather than the airliner. It is interesting to see that even in 2004, Warren claims that there ate "10,000 people" communicating with him about 9/11 conspiracy theories such as his own.
								<br><br>
								Warren is also the creator of the website www.pentagonstrike.co.uk which may be an interesting resource to analyze further. On another website (www.cassiopaea.org), the owner claims that his site would crash because there were so many interested persons visiting after the upload of a video supporting his conspiracy theory.
								<br><br>
								On another note, the article names a few scholars who make various claims about the nature of conspiracy theories. One claim is that it is natural for conspiracies to grow after a traumatic event. Another insight is that in 2004, conspiracy theories seemed to not have any partisan bias in the number of supporters which I find fascinating since many of the claims blame the Bush administration. One of the final claims is that supporters of these conspiracy theories become radical, make it part of their identity, and are very unlikely to ever renounce their beliefs.

							<p>
								<br>
								In this article, Berman dives into the relationship between conspiracy theories, misinformation, the internet, and how 9/11 conspiracy theories enter the classroom of people who may not even remember the event. Berman states that 9/11 is essentially the root of many conspiracy theories in the 21st century. He compares the 9/11 conspiracy theories to more modern ones such as QAnon, Plandemic, and Pizzagate.
								<br><br>
								He compares these three conspiracies as that they are all based on manipulated informational sources that distort reality. Another similarity he assigns is that the ability to view and provide information instantly over the internet has caused conspiracy theory communities to evolve faster and grow larger. Finally, the last similarity is that conspiracy theories ultimately grow large because of human interaction and experiencing positive feedback from one another.
								<br><br>
								Currently, many teachers are noticing conspiracy theories being spread in school, and Berman provides a few approaches teachers can use to combat this. First is to ask the students for evidence to support their theory. Second is to teach about 9/11 conspiracy theories explicitly. Third is to use documentary film to combat conspiracies.

							<p>
								<br>
								Jones notes how conspiracy can be viewed as “knowledge-producing discourse”. The growth of conspiracy theories is easily visible through the inflation of such organizations such as '9/11 Truth Movement' as well as through our government such as the Bush administration's rhetoric surrounding terrorist intention on infiltrating our land. Jones demonstrates the process in which conspiracy theories are formed through constructing her argument, countering her own argument, and deconstructing said counter. Jones grounds her analysis by criticizing members of the 9/11 Truth Movement which makes for an entertaining read.

								Dr. Charles Soukip got his Ph.D. in Communication Studies from the University of Nebraska. His research includes examining communities on the internet, the discourse of film and tv, and digital pop culture text. He has published in multiple journals including The Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication and New Media and Society. This journal article goes over conspiracy theories around 9/11 as well as their influence and misleading legitimacy. Dr. Soukip highlights two sources of the spread of conspiracies being the film Loose Change and the website 911Truth.org. He concludes one of the main reasons people fall into conspiring about major tragedies like 9/11 or the JFK assassination is rooted in egocentrism and a “desire-based reality or hyperreality.”

								Carl Stempel and Guido Stempel were both professors at universities and Thomas Hargrove served in the army but, later went on to become a writer and editor for the International Rice Research Institute. This article survives 1,010 random people and asks them their view of three conspiracy theories regarding the events of 9/11. The writers found evidence that lower social classes and people who consume less legitimate media are more likely to believe at least one of the conspiracies. They found evidence that people who consume legitimate media are less likely to believe any of the conspiracy theories.

								Viren Swami is a Professor of Social Psychology at Anglia Ruskin University in the United Kingdom. Swami introduces the idea that conspiracy theories are built purely off the idea that information is purposely being withheld from the public by multiple actors in order to cover up an event that can be considered a secret, unlawful, or evil plot. Swami highlights the movement behind 9/11 Truth, and how the members frequently met online or through national/international conferences. Swami notes the lack of any empirical research into the construction of conspiracy theories. Swami takes 257 participants in order to study the level of belief in a conspiracy such as the killing of President Kennedy. This lets Swami use a plethora of scales in order to measure the level of belief in a certain conspiracy. This study has begun the examination of the psychological correlations in relation to 9/11 and conspiracy theories themselves.

								This article puts conspiracy theories in the perspectives of the conspiracist and why and how they presented their theories on 9/11. Conspiracistst were largely not willing to apply the “conspiracy” label to their own beliefs and theories and found it objective when others did. Backing up the theory that conspiracy theories carry a social-stigma. Later in the article they conducted a similar research project to our data research project and they took keywords on news websites such as ABC and researched advanced articles on 9/11. Then they extracted all the actually persuasive comments on the articles that related to conspiracies, and posted it onto this article to present what they found. They collected 2174 comments and of them 1459 were coded as conspiracist and 715 as conventionalists. Out of all of the news sites; ABC, CNN, Daily Mail ,and Independent they were all found to have similar amounts of conspiracy theories in the comment sections of the articles. These findings led to the finding that “For many conspiracists, there are two worlds: one real and (mostly) unseen, the other a sinister illusion meant to cover up the truth; and evidence against the latter is evidence for the former.” (Michael J. Wood 2013).

								This is an article written by J McGee in 2011 following the ideas of Richard Hofstadter's essay “the Paranoid Style in American Politics.” Sense that essay;  9/11 conspiracy theories became very popular and well known. This paper looks at a bunch of conspiracy theories including 9/11 and Barack Obama, and how he was not born in the United States. Relating to Richard Hofstadter's  and his early essay on conspiracy theories, we now can understand how that essay foresaw and summarized problems in 1964 with the political system and the conspiracies about it, similarly to now with 9/11. McGee ends the article by stating; “We cannot afford to dismiss such thinking as”crazy” and resist enlightenment ourselves”. He finally puts his full argument at the end and states how he thinks the conspiracies are a good thing and that they make the truth heard even if some of them seem “crazy”.

								Oliver discusses how Americans seem to have a proclivity towards conspiracy theories, and that there has been a surprising dearth of information on how they gain support within the populace. Though there seems to be a relationship with how widespread a theory is with the amount of people believing it, as discussed in the interviews that they staged, asking people about conspiracy theories ranging from Truthers to 9/11. Overall an interesting paper with a few fun charts to peruse over.

								<br>
								Prooijen, Willem, and Vugt's paper talks about conspiracy theories, like 9/11 being an inside job, and puts out two theories and how/why humans are drawn to them. The first one being that it's essentially our ability to recognize patterns working in overdrive. Essentially seeing connections that aren't actually there. The second possible reason is that if a dangerous event happens, our survival instincts want to name a source, so we know to avoid it to, well, live. There even is a tangent on how it may be a function of both, just our brains trying to find out where the dangers in the world are, and seeing connections that aren't there. Overall a fun thinkpiece.
