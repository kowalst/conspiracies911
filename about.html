					<h3>Technical Description</h3>
					<p>The sources we curated were researched meticulously. We were motivated to answer specific questions we had about 9/11 conspiracy theories. Not only was it important for us to answer questions we had but, it was vital to research our sources to validate their accuracy and efficacy. While processing the data in the WayBack Machine we used multiple tools. Part of this project was giving data visualizations to make the data easier to understand and to pull trends or assumptions from the data set. The presentation of our findings was the exciting part of this project. Bringing everything we learned together in one place and making the data, trends, research, and findings more accessible to an audience was time-consuming but, rewarding.</p>

					<h3>Team</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Andrew: research / writing</li>
						<P>Hello! I am a freshman looking to major in Education with a minor in English or Cybersecurity! Grew up in Mt. Vernon where I obtained my diploma and am hopefully looking to graduate from Western in the next few years. Some of my interests include playing the piano, petting cats, and diving into conspiracy theory rabbit holes.</P>
						<li>Flynn: timeline / writing</li>
						<p>Hi! I am a freshman currently undecided, trying to navigate a bunch of different classes hoping to find an interest. I grew up in Fort Collins, Colorado, graduated, then took a gap year, and just moved to Bellingham last summer. My hobbies include soccer, making music (guitar and online), and skiing.</p>
						<li>Nicholas: data visualization / writing</li>
						<p>I am a Junior Environmental Science student. I grew up in Hoquiam Washington and have been living up here in Bellingham for the past 3 years. Some of my hobbies include Daikaiju movies, tabletop games, comic books, and calculating random facts from fiction.</p>
						<li>Payton: research / subject matter expert interview</li>
						<p>Payton is a senior computer science student with a strong interest in the morbid and unorthodox side of the world. One of the ways he has contributed to the project is by organizing and executing an interview with a genuine 9/11 conspiracy theorist. He is a novice in the field of humanities, yet his desire to acquire more knowledge across the fields he is interested in keeps his work ethic sharp to analyze data that is by definition outside the box.</p>
						<li>Thomas: webpage / subject matter expert interview</li>
						<p>I am a super senior Cybersecurity student and I'm minoring in Internet Studies. My passions include mycology, being scared of LeetCode, and long walks on the beach. I grew up in Tacoma where I got my Associate in Cybersecurity and then moved to Bellingham to complete my BS at Western. I'm currently working for a network testing company in Ferndale, yeehaw, but I'm grinding at sharpening my security skills to move onto a security company in Seattle after graduating in spring.</p>
