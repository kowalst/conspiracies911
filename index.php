					<h2>Abstract</h2>
					<P>The Wayback Machine hosts most of the internet and has saved over 652 billion web pages from 1996 to now. A large hot spot of contention on the internet is the terrorist attacks that happened on September 11th, 2001. This project will use the Wayback Machine to track data from the 9/11 terrorist attacks and analyze the networks where this data spreads online. The 9/11 conspiracies became popular with movies like Loose Change and websites like 911truth.org. Theorists claim many things, for example, the deep state staged attacks or the US government knew about the attacks ahead of time, and the alleged fact that jet fuel could not melt steel beams so, the towers should not have fallen. These theories spread on the internet and mainly through social media, conspiracy websites, and political movements with the mission to expose the deep state. We are going to collect websites for our project by analyzing early articles on conspiracy theories starting after 9/11 and following hyperlinks that have been collected into more of a singular category of theories. Our guidelines for the websites are that they have to focus on the media structure, social structure, and the spread of belief in 9/11 conspiracy theories.</P>

					<h2>Introduction</h2>
					<p>The founder of the Internet Archive is Brewster Kahle, his career's focus was to provide “universal access to all knowledge”. This led to the creation of his first site “Thinking Machines”, then “Wide Area Information” and later “Alexa Internet” which finally led to the creation of the “Internet Archive” in 1996. The Internet Archive is now a massive, non-profit library that works with 400 universities and libraries to create a place where anyone can claim a free account in order to view or upload media</p>

					<h2>Design/Format of the Internet Archive</h2>
					<p>The Archive is spread out in a library format. First, highlighting the sections of collected books, movies, software, music, and websites. Through the navigation bar, you can also find previous projects that include large collections, services, and tools that can help you navigate the site into more precise areas or dates. The largest tool is “The WayBack Machine”, which is basically a search bar for all of the collected media on the site. There is also a location on the site that is used for blog posts, announcements, and events. They update this part of the site regularly; updating users of new collections, or events that are being added to the site. The quality and consistency of the information seen in the library largely depends on the date and/or user who uploaded the media. Some collections seem worn or incomplete because of how old the information is; mostly when it comes to books.</p>

					<h2>Wayback Machine</h2>
					<p>One of the most impressive and interesting collections in the Internet Archive is the Wayback Machine. The Wayback Machine was started at the dawn of the Internet Archive with one of the first iterations of a web crawler in 1996, and began collecting data to provide snapshots of early internet websites. A basic example of what this provides is the ability to browse the web as if you were in an earlier time period, hence the name of the service. For instance, you may use the service to see what amazon.com looked like when it was first invented in the '90s. This can be used as an invaluable tool for analyzing early web culture, as well as documenting various historical events and the historiography of how they were reported by their contemporaries. The Wayback Machine is a perfect example of documents on the internet lasting forever. We will use it to dive into various technical and historical concepts throughout our research period</p>

					<h2>Possibilities/Limits</h2>
					<p>The possibilities of the Internet Archive are massive. There is an approximated 45 petabytes (~90% of the collected data from the Library of Congress in 2015) worth of data that is stored. The collections that are readily available can range from something as generic as CNBC to something as niche as LEGO stop motion films. There seems to be little to no regulations or limitations to what can be uploaded to the Archive. There are collections that consist of Nazi war crimes, albums, video game files, pictures, videos, books, and websites that date back to the mid-2000s. All of the items on the Archive were uploaded by different users, so there are some collections that aren't as full as others. As vast as the collection of data is, the users that would benefit the most from this collection are probably your average software engineer or developer. There are millions of resources one can use to their advantage.</p>

					<h2>How/Why</h2>
					<p>Data is uploaded by any user free of charge, allowing any format to be within the server. And since it's uploaded and curated by quasi-anonymous internet users, this allows a unique database full of both the typical news articles and also pieces of various special interests. People can also archive web pages allowing users to save a snapshot of a website at any point in time. Once data is collected, it then is organized by a series of tags that one can look up to find later, similar to looking up a scientific paper in the Western Washington University library system. The categories can include but are not limited to the following: Media types, audio, movies, texts and data, availability, the year it was released, and the topic section</p>

					<h2>Efficacy</h2>
					<p>Hosting so much data for free, may be a problem for the data creators and owners. In 2020 the Internet Archive launched a service that would allow users to view and/or download digital copies of roughly 1.4 million books without a waiting list called the National Emergency Library. Authors argue this is piracy because libraries get licenses for books directly from the publishers but the Internet Archive does not and instead lends books under fair use through a theory called controlled digital lending. Data hosted by Internet Archive were originally bought then “loaned” with a one-to-one ratio which is covered under fair use laws. The project also helps spread knowledge to people who may not have been able to access the materials originally.</p>

					<p>Hosting data is one thing and protecting people who access the data is another. In 2013 Internet Archive upgraded its internet protocols to HTTPS to secure users' internet traffic and IPs from being hijacked. Brewster Kahle, the founder of Internet Archive, took another step to protect his user's rights when interacting with his website. In 2007, the FBI served a national security letter (NSL) asking for personal information about users and Kahle responded by handing over only publicly available documents and a lawsuit challenging the letter. Kahle won that lawsuit and the FBI had to withdraw their letter because it was unconstitutional. This was the first NSL that had been challenged by a library.</p>

					<h2>Questions</h2>
					<ol>
						<li>How did the internet affect the proliferation and mainstream appeal of 9/11 conspiracy theories?</li>
						<li>How did the magnitude of conspiracy theories change in regards to the difference between the theories and official narrative between the years 2003 and 2016.</li>
						<li>Was the spread of conspiracy theories over the internet mostly affected by individual blogs and websites or more corporatized social media?</li>
							<ol>
								<li class="feature-lowercase-list">And how did the information sourcing of online conspiracies change from 2003 to 2016?</li>
							</ol>
						<li>Why did the volume of 9/11 conspiracy oriented websites significantly increase around 2005-2006 rather than sooner or later post-tragedy </li>
						<li>How did the links between the independent 9/11 conspiracy blog sites increase or decrease between 2003 to 2016 and what does this mean in regards to the unity or division in the 9/11 conspiracy community?</li>
