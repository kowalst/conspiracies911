						<h2>Subject Matter Expert Interview</h2>
						<p>Thomas: What? Um, so I know the article was posted in 2001. Was that when the study was conducted?</p>
						<p>Dr. Stempel: No, it was. It was published in 2007.</p>
						<p>Thomas: oh I'm sorry, 2007.</p>
						<p>Dr. Stempel: And, and I'm trying to remember when the survey, it's been a while since I've looked at this stuff. I think the survey was done In 2007. I would have said, I could go back and look, but I thought it was more the survey was done more around 2003. Or a little later, it might have been, you know, what, actually, I think it was actually done in 2006. It was several years after. Yeah, we wanted to capture how much the you know, how much the conspiracy thinking was good was still circulating at that point.</p>
						<p>Thomas: Okay. All right.</p>
						<p>Dr. Stempel: Yeah, I think it was 2006 actually.</p>
						<p>Thomas: Okay. And then, um, so for the the study that you conducted, you were looking at different media sources that the individuals were consuming, including, like the, like tabloids, and then..</p>
						<p>Dr. Stempel: like radio, regular news coverage. Do you think that social media back then didn't have the same? I mean, it existed, you know, Myspace? I don't remember exactly when Facebook started, but it didn't have the same. The same, I don't know, didn't have the same kind of influence. So what it was, you know, it thinks things were were somewhat interactive, but they didn't circulate conspiracies. My sense. And, and I, it's, again, it's been a while is that they didn't circulate as rapidly as they do now. Yeah. Dead as widely as they do, as they do now. Bye. Bye, kind of a long shot quite a bit less. But we are aware that they were and we wanted to see, you know, we wanted to we wanted to establish if this relationship was already emerging.</p>
						<p>Thomas: Yeah. And then I was a little bit younger, back then. But was there like, a similar media bias at that time as there is today? Because like, now we have CNN and Fox News and then..</p>
						<p>Dr. Stempel: MSNBC. Yeah. So I would say that, again, I'm not an expert on this, but thinks it probably gotten more polarized. Certainly, Fox was already to a great extent how they are now. But they did. One of the things I don't know if you noticed this in the article, but one of the things is that Fox News did not trade trading conspiracy as much as they do now. There's a there's, again, I so I kind of have to preface everything I say by saying you know that there are other people who are much more up on this, I've moved on to studying other things. And i, i from i pay attention to some of it. I've developed viewpoints on things. But I don't not all of them. So some of the things I'm going to say are kind of my general sense is that if you look at more closely, you may find out I'm wrong. Right now, I'm just practicing that that way. I would say that things are more polarized now. But sometimes when people say polarized, it just makes it so you know, it's kind of this. There's like it's symmetrical. And there's there's really good studies. If you're if you haven't read them, I can recommend what you can email me and I can recommend a book like set of studies. That just I can't I can't say it right now that They showed pretty convincingly that conspiracy thinking on in the right wing media gets brought to the mainstream more quickly. Yeah. Much more quickly than it does on the on the left. So the basic model would be that, yeah, there's left wing conspiracy thinking, and there's right wing conspiracy thinking, and then there's kind of stuff that's, you know, sort of more generic. But one of the things that I'm sure you since you're focusing on 911 stuff, I'm pretty sure you're aware that when we did our study, if it leans more towards liberals and Democrats..</p>
						<p>Thomas: yeah, I thought that was really interesting, actually.</p>
						<p>Dr. Stempel: Yeah. And it makes sense. If you think about the model we developed with regard to trust, which I think a lot of other people have expanded on. Much better than we did. We were, you know, we were kind of the field didn't have a lot. We didn't have a lot to reference when we did our study. But we we glommed on to the idea of trust being central, pretty early on, and I believe we drew on, work on rumors, to some extent that was, you know, was focusing, you know, focused on trust, as well. But But at any rate, they thinks we're, at the time, you know, the 911 conspiracies, they all kind of made the Bush administration complicit. And there were there were, you know, there were tons of liberals and Democrats who felt that Bush had stolen the 2000 election and had fabricated the excuse to go into Iraq. And so there was, there was a very, right around 2006, there was a very low level of trust in Bush by people on the left. And it's that distrust that opens you to believing conspiracies, to summit that's at least one important model to have in mind. And so and so, as as, you know, as things have gotten, as more distance has come. And in the right, my view of things is that the right has has sort of hit on conspiracy thinking as a way to mobilize people more than the Democrats have certainly in a mainstream way that, that I believe, it's if people go through I'm not sure what all different methods it would take. But I think you'd be able to tease out that that. You know, that was very much related to this shift to where now? It's I don't think it's super strong, but the majority of 911 conspiracy believers are right wingers now. So there's been a transition that way.</p>
						<p>Thomas: Yeah, no, I found that part of the article really interesting. Actually, that was gonna be my next question for you.</p>
						<p>Dr. Stempel: Okay.</p>
						<p>Thomas: So at the start of the article, it was talking about a, like us versus them, like thinking style, and then a paranoid thinking style. There's a another research article that was reading, and they made the assumption that more people who believe in conspiracies, they have like a kind of like egotistical, like viewpoint and thinking that they know more than everyone else, and that kind of thrives, their thinking more interesting.</p>
						<p>Dr. Stempel: Okay. So so you want to know what I think of that, or?</p>
						<p>Thomas: Yeah, just your opinion.</p>
						<p>Dr. Stempel: Okay. Well, I'll try not to be too long winded, but but I do actually. I I would need to look at it more closely. But my initial reaction is that I, I would find that less helpful. Yeah, I get I'm going to give you an example because maybe helps me understand or has a recent study that didn't focus especially on conspiracy thinking. But that help helps. That kind of fits in with my way of thinking about it the way that it's evolved, it's sort of building off I still think that the trust is is central. Another thing that I think you'll see is that it has been we emphasize, you know, kind of a degree There's also an element of kind of social and political alienation. And so there's a there's a study, it's not a it's not certainly study or quantitative study done by a sociologist named Jennifer Silva. And the title of the book is we're still here. And she looks at and she goes into, she does an ethnography of an answer of a dying anthracite coal town in kind of North and a little west of Philadelphia. And, and what she shows is that a lot of the people there whose whose parents or grandparents were coal miners, strong union people, strong Democrats pro, you know, engaged in a number, you know, in a lot of kind of collective solidarity, that, that they that they now don't trust anyone that the younger generation thinks have gone so bad, and so downhill. And there's so few opportunities where they live. And they're, you know, there's, you know, there's a good amount of drug addiction and things like that, that they, that they've come to rely only on themselves. And so if I was to look from the outside, look at that, and say, Oh, they're being egotistical in some in some of the people, and a good number of these people, as they try and make sense of the world, because they have so little trust, there's the theme of trust, again, they have so little trust in government. They have so little trust in, in other institutions. And they in the, you know, they kind of, I mean, everybody's heard the phrase, you know, trust no one they take, they take that as like an ethos. Okay, yeah. And you could see that as being egotistical, but I, as a sociologist would see it more as a, as a somewhat justified I don't agree with them, but a somewhat justified you know, social isolation, you know, alienation, social alienation, or social isolation that they've had, their, their family relationships that they've been let down by their work relationships, they're exploited in through casualized. Labor, it's underpaid, you know, things like that. And so I went in off the bat without knowing anything else. If I if I heard somebody say, yeah, it's either egotistical, I would be, I would be looking at and say, how much of what you're leaving labeling egotistical? And they would sound egotistical they would they, you know, they develop these elaborate conspiracies, that makes them feel like they're in control of things. Right. Yeah, they, they feel like, Oh, I've got a handle. Everybody else is kind of duped, you know, and stuff like that. But that, that I I would be, I would feel that it was a was biased. Call them egotistical now. That you may be there. I can see that as an element as long as you're looking at the broader context.</p>
						<p>And the other thing I would say is that I is that I do believe that there are different types. So I'm not saying, you know, they could be actually referencing a different type. And, you know, that I'm just not familiar with or haven't thought through about. And so that could, that could be what's going on as well. The final thing that I feel compelled to say now, and then I told you, I was going to try not to be too long. The final thing, I'll say now is that I believe that all of us are capable, because I see it as as as as conspiracy thinking, as you know, related to social relations of trust. is very much, you know, or at least the type that I would focus on the that trust and I guess the other thing I would add would be loss, maybe especially status loss. But but that because of that I I think that we're all capable of in situations. You know, where where we've lost trust and leaders or trust in institutions that have grounded us in the past? I know, you know, my dad was a member of union and I no longer trust union, sir. You know, that kind of thing. Yeah. That, that we're, we're all capable of developing conspiracy type thinking. And then we have other forces within us that, you know, the pushback against that. Right. But the, but we, I think those impulses are one of the things we tried to do, it was very hard to do with just survey data, right. But one of the things we tried to do was to avoid, and we and we are quite explicit about how we, we felt that I guess the summarize that I can say that hosters view, even though there's no doubt something to that the paranoid style and American thoughts in the how it comes, especially from the right. The we, we try to, to, we felt that that pathologized it too much, it pathologized it psychologize that too much. And that's why we emphasize those, those other things.</p>
